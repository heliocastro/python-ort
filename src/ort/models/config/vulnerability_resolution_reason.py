    Possible reasons for resolving a Vulnerability using a VulnerabilityResolution.

    Properties:
        CANT_FIX_VULNERABILITY:
            No remediation is available for this vulnerability.
            For example, it requires a change to be made by a third party that is not responsive.

        INEFFECTIVE_VULNERABILITY:
            The code in which the vulnerability was found is neither invoked in the project's code
            nor indirectly via another open source component.

        INVALID_MATCH_VULNERABILITY:
            The vulnerability is irrelevant due to a tooling or database mismatch.
            For example, the package version used does not match the version for which the
            vulnerability provider has reported a vulnerability.

        MITIGATED_VULNERABILITY:
            The vulnerability is valid but has been mitigated.
            For example, measures have been taken to ensure this vulnerability cannot be exploited.

        NOT_A_VULNERABILITY:
            The vulnerability was reported and got a CVE assigned.
            However, the CVE was later deemed to not be a vulnerability.

        WILL_NOT_FIX_VULNERABILITY:
            This vulnerability will never be fixed.
            For example, the package which is affected is orphaned, declared end-of-life,
            or otherwise deprecated.

        WORKAROUND_FOR_VULNERABILITY:
            The vulnerability is valid but a temporary workaround has been put in place
            to avoid exposure to the vulnerability.
